Challenge

Build an AI-powered advisory system that allows farmers to ask queries in their own language (preferably Malayalam) and receive accurate, context-aware answers instantly.

Core Features

- Natural Language Query Handling: Farmers can ask questions via voice or text in Malayalam—e.g., “Which pesticide for leaf spot in my banana?”
- Multimodal Inputs: Support for image uploads (e.g., diseased crop photo) or voice notes.
- AI-Powered Knowledge Engine: Use LLMs and fine-tuned agri datasets to provide reliable, tailored answers—drawing from local crop calendars, pest advisories, weather, and scheme guidelines.
- Context Awareness: Factor in the farmer’s location, crop, season, and history (if known) to give personalized advice.
- Escalation System: For complex or unclear queries, escalate to local agri officers with context and suggestions.
- Learning Loop: Continuously improve the system using real queries, feedback, and local expert inputs.

Expected Impact

- Makes expert-level farming advice instantly accessible to all.
- Bridges the communication gap between farmers and extension systems.
- Supports Krishibhavans and Agri Departments by automating first-level support.

This system aims to become a “Digital Krishi Officer”—always available, always learning, and always farmer-first.
